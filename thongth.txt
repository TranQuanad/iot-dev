Hello world is where it all begins.It works on my machine!Good software is like a good joke—it needs no explanation.A programmer’s life: Eat, Sleep, Code, Repeat.Any sufficiently advanced bug is indistinguishable from a feature.A programmer is a machine that turns coffee into code.Code like there is no tomorrow.If code comments are longer than the code, you’re doing it wrong.Programming is an art.Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NullPointerException.Nothing is impossible, except estimating project timelines accurately.One does not simply write bug-free code.Sometimes, code is poetry. Sometimes, it’s horror.Fix one bug, introduce two more.Debugging is like being the detective in a crime movie where you are also the murderer.Bugs are not errors; they are unexpected features.Code like you mean it.Readability counts.Just because it compiles doesn’t mean it works.If you like debugging, you’ll love JavaScript.Try, catch, cry.idovoa.ra
